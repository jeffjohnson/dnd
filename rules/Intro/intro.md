# Intro
## What is this?
What is Jeff's D&D? Why, it's my version of D&D, of course. It combines mostly the Moldvay/Cook versions of Basic D&D (B/X) with some features included from various other sources. I like a simple game, and this is my attempt to start with *simple* (B/X) and layer on some things that, in my estimation, improve the game in some way.

I try to highlight differences between this version and the core rules wherever changes are to be found so as to help you understand what's different.

This book is meant mostly as a table reference during play. It doesn't try to teach D&D or give examples unless I feel like they are useful. I encourage everyone to make D&D their own. You can use anything in this book and if you want to credit me, great, if not, I don't care. I'll try to credit any ideas I have lifted or found online, but if I miss something, then I'm sorry. I'll try to fix it in the source material if you drop me a message urieal@gmail.com.
## Acknowledgments
I wish to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who has worked on every iteration of D&D. I especially want to thank the late Gary Gygax for being the driving force behind this phenomenon and one of its primary originators.

Your work speaks volumes Mr. Gygax, and you are sorely missed.

I would like to specifically thank Dr. J Eric Holmes, Tom Moldvay, Steve Marsh, Zeb Cook, Frank Mentzer, Aaron Allston, Monte Cook, Skip Williams, Jonathan Tweet, Rob Heinsoo, Mike Mearls, James Wyatt, Jeremy Crawford, Chris Perkins, and Bruce Cordell for their contributions to various versions of D&D and AD&D throughout the years.

## Organization
There are several print books in Jeff's D&D. They are meant to make things easier for players at the table. This is the first book, the Player's Handbook. Here's a list of all of the books in the series:
* Book One: Player's Handbook (PHB)
* Book Two: Book of Magic (BoM)
* Book Three: DM's Guide (DMG)
* Book Four: Monsters & Treasure (M&T)

Each of these has page numbers that are prefixed with the abbreviations above. This book, for example, has pages listed as PHB##. This allows for easy reference 

### That's great, how's this book organized?
This book has different sections. To make it easy to reference the different aspects of the game. It is organized as follows: 
1. Intro
2. Character Creation (PH##)
3. Backgrounds (PH##)
4. Classes (PH##)
5. Equipment
6. Magic
7. Adventuring
8. Combat
9. Higher Level Play
10. Everything Else

### Definitions of standard D&D terms
These terms are used throughout this and all other of Jeff's D&D books. The referee is called the **Dungeon Master (DM)**. You are called a **player**. The character you control is called the **player character (PC)**. One of the defining characteristics of your PC is their ability scores. There are six; **Strength (STR)**, **Dexterity (DEX)**, **Constitution (CON)**, **Intelligence (INT)**, **Wisdom (WIS)**, and **Charisma (CHA)**. Everyone your PC meets in the world is called either a **non-player character (NPC)** or a **monster**. PCs and *some* NPCs belong to a **class**, which defines their race and skillset. PCs gain **experience (XP)** by defeating enemies and gaining treasure. Treasure is awarded as pieces of precious metals; **platinum (PP)**, **gold (GP)**, **electrum (EP)**, **silver (SP)**, and **copper (CP)**. Your PC advances in **level** by gaining XP. Advancing in a level increases your PC's **hit points (HP)**, which is a measure of their toughness and skill. Your PC's **saving throws (Save)**, which help your PC avoid catastrophe, also increase at certain levels. As your PC gains levels, they increase in combat ability and their **attack bonus (AB)** goes up, making it easier to hit enemies. There are two types of combat, **ranged** and **melee**. Melee combat is hand-to-hand and ranged combat happens at a distance.
